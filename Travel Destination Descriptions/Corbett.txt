Corbett, officially known as Jim Corbett National Park, is India's oldest national park and a renowned wildlife sanctuary located in the state of Uttarakhand. Established in 1936, the park is named after Jim Corbett, a British-Indian hunter, naturalist, and conservationist, who played a crucial role in establishing the region as a protected area to conserve wildlife.

Covering an area of approximately 520 square kilometers (201 square miles), Corbett National Park is characterized by diverse landscapes, including dense forests, grasslands, riverine belts, and hilly terrains. It is situated in the foothills of the Himalayas, along the banks of the Ramganga River.

The park is famous for its significant population of Bengal tigers and is considered one of the best places in India to spot these majestic predators in the wild. Besides tigers, Corbett is also home to other wildlife species such as Indian elephants, leopards, spotted deer, sambar deer, wild boars, and various bird species, making it a paradise for wildlife enthusiasts and birdwatchers.

The park is divided into different zones, each offering a unique wildlife experience. Bijrani, Dhikala, Jhirna, and Dhela are some of the popular zones open to tourists for safaris.

Corbett National Park remains open for visitors from mid-November to June, as it is closed during the monsoon season for conservation purposes.

In addition to its wildlife attractions, Corbett holds historical significance as the location of the famous "Man-Eaters of Kumaon" incidents, documented by Jim Corbett himself in his books.
